# Example input file for gss.f90
#
# Version 17.060
#

# System:
psf ./toy.psf
dcd ./production.dcd

# Group definitions: group1 and group2 can be VMD-style selections
# if the program is running from the gss.sh script (and VMD is available)
solute segname BGLC
solvent resname TIP3 and name OH2

# Otherwise, use a pdb file with beta factors (1.00 for group1 and 2.00 for group2)
# and "1.00" in the occupancy factor for the excluded selection.
#groups ./teste.pdb

# Output GSS file:
output gss.dat

# Options to consider frames
firstframe 1
lastframe last
stride 1

# Periodic cell (use: no, readfromdcd, or three real numbers)
periodic readfromdcd
#periodic 80.785998702 80.7870016098 80.78000

# cutoff: The maximum distance that must be considered for calculations.
# The greater the better but, of course, not too great so that periodic
# boundary conditions come into play. Also, calculations become slower
# with the square of the cutoff. 
cutoff 16.

# dbulk: The distance from the solute from which it is believed that
# the solution behaves as a bulk solution (the distance above which
# the influence of the solute on the solvent structure is negligible).
dbulk 14.

# binstep: The width of the histogram. It will not affect results, but
# it may affect the smoothness of the plots. Greater bins, greater smoothness,
# but the details are lost.
binstep 0.02

# nint: An integer parameter controling the precision of the numerical volume
# integration. The greater nint, the greater the precision (but at a cost
# proportional to nint).  
nint 10

# Use this option if you are running the package and printing the output
# on the screen:
#onscreenprogress
