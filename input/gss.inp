# System:
psf ./large.psf
dcd ./production-large.dcd

# Group definitions: group1 and group2 can be VMD-style selections
# if the program is running from the gss.sh script (and VMD is available)
solute resname TIP3 and residue 100
solvent resname TIP3 and not residue 100

# Otherwise, use a pdb file with beta factors (1.00 for group1 and 2.00 for group2)
# and "1.00" in the occupancy factor for the excluded selection.
#groups ./teste.pdb

# Output GSS file:
output gss.dat

# dbulk: The distance from the solute from which it is believed that
# the solution behaves as a bulk solution (the distance above which
# the influence of the solute on the solvent structure is negligible). 
# This distance must be smaller than half of the periodic length of
# the box. It is also used as a cutoff for distance calculations, so
#that increasing it makes computations more costly.  
dbulk 16.

# binstep: The width of the histogram. It will not affect results, but
# it may affect the smoothness of the plots. Greater bins, greater smoothness,
# but the details are lost.
binstep 0.02

# nint: An integer parameter controling the precision of the numerical volume
# integration. The greater nint, the greater the precision (but at a cost
# proportional to nint).  
nint 10

# Use this option if you are running the package and printing the output
