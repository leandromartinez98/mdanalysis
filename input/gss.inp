# Version 16.337

# System:
psf /home/leandro/Downloads/ivan0.psf
dcd /home/leandro/Downloads/ivan0.dcd

# Group definitions: group1 and group2 can be VMD-style selections
# if the program is running from the gss.sh script (and VMD is available)
solute protein and hydrophobic
solvent resname TIP3

# Optionally, you can set a different selection from the solute to be the
# volume excluded in the computation (this affects the normalization of
# the gss function). For example, the excluded volume can be a complete
# protein, while the gss is computed only for the hydrophobic residues.
# If "exclude" is not set, it will be the "solute" selection. 
exclude protein

# Otherwise, use a pdb file with beta factors (1.00 for group1 and 2.00 for group2)
# and "1.00" in the occupancy factor for the excluded selection.
#groups ./teste.pdb

# Output GSS file:
output gss.dat

# Options to consider frames
firstframe 1
lastframe last
stride 1

# Periodic cell (use: no, readfromdcd, or three real numbers)
periodic readfromdcd
#periodic 80.785998702 80.7870016098 80.78000

# Cutoff (default: 10.)
cutoff 10.

# Options for the gss slabing, usually you dont need to set them,
# default parameters are fine. 
# gssmax is the maximum distance to be considered and nslabs is
# the number of volume slices within 0. and gssmax.
#gssmax 20.
#nslabs 1000

# Density of the system: Used for the simple estimation of solute
# volume. Default value is 1 g/ml
#density 1.

# Probe side: Used for the estimation of the solute volume
# Default: 2 Angstrom.
probeside 2.
