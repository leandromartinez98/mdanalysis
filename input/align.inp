# Group definitions: mobile and reference can be VMD-style selections
# if the program is running from the align.sh script (and VMD is available)
# The RMSD of the "compute_rmsd_of" selection will be computed twice: First, the
# the internal mobility is computed (that is, it is aligned to itself and
# the normal RMSD is calculated). Second, the "reference" selection is
# aligned and the RMSD the "compute_rmsd_of" selection are computed
# according to the new movements. 
# Therefore, this provides a measure of the relative movements
# between the two selections. If "compute_rmsd_of" and "reference" 
# are the same, the results will be identical.

# Otherwise, use a pdb file with beta factors 
# (1.00 for the reference and 2.00 for compute_rmsd_of)

# Reference frame for alignment examples:
# Align to an external dcd file:
#alignto ../structures/ppar+rosi.12.apo.pdb
# Align to the first or last frame of the dcd file:
#alignto dcdfirst
#alignto dcdlast
# Align to frame 1000 from the DCD file (or any other):
#alignto 1000
# Align to average structure from dcd file:
alignto dcdaverage

# Output files:
# This file contains the RMSD as a function of the simulation frames.

output align.dat

# This file (optional) is a pdb file containing the "mobile" selection
# aligned to itself (this may be a huge file!)

#writeinter inter.pdb

# This file (optional) is a pdb file of all selections in which the
# "reference" selection is aligned (this may be a huge file!)

#writerel relative.pdb

# This file (optional) contains the time-averaged RMSD of each residue relative
# through the simulation. The alignment considered is the alignment of the
# 'reference' atoms. It is a PDB file, containing in the "occupancy" column the 
# absolute RMSD values, and in the "b-factor" column the same data scaled 
# between 0 and 1.

# Frames to be considered:
