# * IMPORTANT:
#
# There are two ways to define the emission vector. The
# first is to directly define it, as the absorption vector, using the 
# average position of two series of atoms. You would want to use this
# option if you know how to define the emission vector in terms of the
# position of the atoms. In this case, use theta = 0 (or comment the
# theta definition line).
#
# The second option, usually more common, is when you know a good way to
# define the absorption vector from atomic positions, but you cannot do
# the same for the emission vector. You probably know the angle between
# the two vectors, and more or less the plane in which they are
# contained. In this case, the definition of the emission vector serves
# ONLY to, in conjunction with the absorption vector, define the plane
# in which these two vectors are contained. The emission vector will be
# computed by a rotation of the absorption vector, in this plane,
# according to angle theta. A good idea is to check the definition of
# the vectors that are output in the first frame over the structure,
# using the "draw line" VMD command.

# point, and the index of the atoms follow.
